My paper "Estimating electricity impact profiles for building characteristics using smart meter data and mixed models" [@Roach2019-ch] was recently accepted by the journal _Energy and Buildings_. Code for this paper is now available on GitHub at my [1801-mmme](https://github.com/camroach87/1801-MMME) repository.
