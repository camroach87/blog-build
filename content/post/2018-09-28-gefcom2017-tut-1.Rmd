_Update (28 January, 2020). I have decided to post the paper's code in dedicated GitHub repositories instead of a tidied up walkthrough._

Code, R markdown files and a preprint of the paper _Reconciled boosted models for GEFCom2017 hierarchical probabilistic load forecasting_ [@Roach2018-pf] can be found at my [1701-gefcom](https://github.com/camroach87/1701-gefcom) github repository.

A dedicated package that includes the tidied competition data in `.rda` format can be found at my [gefcom2017data](https://github.com/camroach87/gefcom2017data) repository. This repository also includes the original excel spreadsheets released by [ISO New England](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/load-and-demand/-/tree/zone-info), [US federal holidays](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/) and the functions used to tidy and format the raw data.
