# blog-build

Files to build blog. Based on nodejh hugo-theme-cactus-plus.

## Instructions

1. Posts go in the `content/post` directory. Easiest to just copy and paste an old one and update date as required.
2. Run `blogdown::serve_site()` to run the site locally.
3. If the site looks ok it's time to commit. In terminal, navigate to the `public` directory and add/commit/push.
